*DISCLAIMER: The below references an opinion and is for information purposes only. It is not intended to be investment advice.  Seek a duly licensed professional for investment advice. I own a long position in MTRN stock and the below reflects personal opinions that informed my investment decision.*

[Materion (MTRN)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MTRN/) is a mining company focused on the production of [Beryllium (Be)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium). Beryllium is a light metal that's used in special applications where properties like weight, stiffness, and temperature are valued. [According to the USGS](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020.pdf), application industries for Beryllium include:

- Industrial components: 21% of usage
- Aerospace & defense: 20%
- Automotive electronics: 14%
- Consumer electronics: 14%
- Telecom infrastructure: 14%
- Energy applications: 9%
- Semiconductor applications: 1%

Not surprisingly, Beryllium is regarded as a strategic asset by the US government and really governments around the world. To that end, the US does stockpile some for future use.

I hope all that context didn't put you to sleep, because it's about to get interesting. Here's a fact - [90% of worldwide beryllium production happens in the US](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020.pdf). And Materion is the sole producer. 

That's right, they're selling a commodity - but they have a near worldwide monopoly.

# Industry Analysis

Conducting an industry analysis on this company is different to say the least. I think there are a few dimensions that can be ruled as **LOW** threat immediately:

- Suppliers
- Customers
- Competition
- Complements

That leaves us three other dimensions to think about. 

In terms of new entrants, I believe the threat here is actually **MEDIUM** to **HIGH**. The US is not allied with everyone in the world and Beryllium is mostly used for industrial & aerospace applications. It doesn't take much to connect the dots that countries like China, Russia, and similarly allied countries would want their own supply. In fact, the [second largest producer of Beryllium in the world right now **is** China](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264925/world-beryllium-production/).

I expect China would likely ramp up production as necessary over the coming years. There have also been [rumblings](https://metalukraine.com/2017/01/27/russia-to-resume-beryllium-manufacture.html) [since 2015](https://www.rbth.com/news/2015/12/17/russia-to-design-its-first-beryllium-production-in-2016_551917) that Russia will start [production in earnest in 2020](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2016/3081/fs20163081.pdf). Whether this will come to pass is unknown to me, but it's worth noting the risk definitely exists.

When it comes to substitutes, the threat here is **LOW**. [Per the USGS](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2016/3081/fs20163081.pdf):

> As a function of its unique chemical and physical properties, such as a high stiffness-toweight ratio, resistance to temperature extremes, and high thermal conductivity, beryllium cannot be easily replaced by substitute materials in applications where combinations of these properties make it the material of choice.

Overall seems like quite an attractive industry to be in - even noting the worries about new entrants.

# Company Analysis

My biggest worry about investing in any company right now is their ability to weather the current COVID-19 headwinds. To read more about my thoughts on COVID-19, [you can check out my post on it](https://www.aadhi.rocks/posts/covid-19/). Although I have no worry about the long-run, I do have short-run worries about capital availability & [GDP impact](https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-coronavirus-shutdowns-have-taken-29-of-u-s-economy-offline-11586079001?mod=djemDailyShot&mod=djemDailyShot).

As a result, right now I'm zeroing in on company cash flows, debt loads, and investment grades. Obviously these are all things you'd consider when there wasn't a pandemic going on, but I think it's even more important at this moment. There's no shortage of battered stock prices, but there is a shortage of companies on solid footing.

With that said, I think it's interesting to note that despite being in a capital intensive industry - MTRN has next to no long-term debt on their balance sheet. They also have healthy operating cash flows (OCFs) of $70M - $90M annually. Finally, they have a cash balance of $125M.

All that to say - the company is on solid footing to survive the inenvitable downturn in top-line this year.

# My Decision & Rationale

I bought at an average cost of $34.87. Big spoilers.

My rationale is relatively simple - I expect that in the long-run Beryllium will continue to be vital in the applications where it has proven its worth. Industries like industrial components, aerospace & defense, and so on are not going anywhere. With little ability to substitute and majority of the production coming from MTRN - I expect a reversion to average cash flows that have been demonstrated in the past after the COVID-19 pandemic passes.

The big risk that I see is the entry of other governments like Russia and the continued expansion of production from China. I think this is a bit of a funky market in the sense that US allies likely won't buy from China & Russia and vice-versa for aerospace & defense applications - but perhaps the other markets would get more price competitive.

After running some of these potential scenarios via DCF, $34.87 seemed like a price that offers good margin of safety for me. I believe the fair price is somewhere near $48.50 / share and plan to hold for up to 5 years to realize that price.

# Concluding Words

This was an extremely interesting company to analyze. It's selling a commodity, yet has a monopoly. This becomes starkly clear when you [compare the $ / kg price of Beryllium ($857) vs. Copper ($6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prices_of_chemical_elements). Crazy.

There's just a whole universe of interesting business out there.
