I believe in considering the double bottom line of your decisions. This means taking into consideration not just the economic ramifications of your actions - but the social ones as well.

Too often I feel like our society glorifies people who accumulate massive amounts of wealth with no discretion for how they did it. As long as it was legal, it's OK.
