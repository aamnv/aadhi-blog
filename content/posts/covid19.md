**Quick note before I jump into it**: COVID-19 is an unfortunate catastrophe. It has brought suffering and pain to many. While I sit here in relative isolation - I don't have much to contribute to the medical side of this disaster. However, I do have some thoughts on the economic impact which may help assauge those who are worried about the pain to be felt going forward.

There's quite a bit of chatter these days about a potential long-term recession triggered by COVID-19. Looking quickly at the S&P 500 index - you might even hazard to believe it. After all, the [market is down 30%+ from Feb 21st to Mar 20th](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=^GSPC&.tsrc=fin-srch).

But does this really mean we're going to slip into a long-term recession? Not necessarily. In fact, it really shouldn't mean that at all. The core of what determines long-run economic output are three factors: labor, capital, and productivity. 

# The Long-Run Impact

Those factors should make intuitive sense to most. If you have more hands (labor), then you can produce more. If you have more machines (capital), then you can produce more. And if those hands are more efficient at making things, then you can produce more. Obviously there's a lot of gotcha's hidden in those simple statements, but they should generally hold.

Now let's use that framework to examine the impact COVID-19 would have on each factor. Capital & productivity should be relatively untouched. It's not like the disease is out there destroying infrastructure we've built. And hands aren't getting any less efficient.

Labor is a different story. There will definitely be some impact on the labor force as a result of COVID-19. But perhaps it'll be less than what the market has currently priced in. After all, the high-impact groups will be [seniors ages 65+](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm). These folks have likely retired and been removed from the labor force already. Therefore, although the loss of life is dire - the impact on economic productivity should be minimal.

All of this leads me to believe that the long-run impacts on the US economy should be muted and we might be witnessing a potential market overreaction.

# Government Reaction

In fact, there's reason to believe that things may even end up going **too well**. One notable response to the market downturn has been the [reduction of the Fed Funds Rate to 0% - 0.25%](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-cuts-rates-to-zero-and-launches-massive-700-billion-quantitative-easing-program.html). By providing banks more liquidity, the Fed is likely hoping to induce economic activity.

Assuming normal behavior, this should lead to increased consumption by people and investment by businesses. That in turn would lead to an increase in GDP or economic output via:

GDP = C + I + G + (X-M); when C (consumer spending) & I (investment) go up, assuming G (government spending) & (X-M) (net exports) hold - GDP has to go up to balance.

# Risks of Perception

Although that sounds good on paper, all of this is at risk if the expectation of the general US population is that we're entering a recession. Even though money can be acquired at reasonable costs, if  consumers and businesses aren't willing to spend - then we'll enter a recession regardless. I believe this is the real risk facing the US economy today. Not anything structural, rather something purely psychological.

It doesn't help that every other day I read some article talking about the exchange circuit breakers being triggered, or how [small businesses are going to die](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IUTHX2kTagUUV88HUJCkp_P6iZgLCXXVHD9UeOwU_1w/mobilepresent?slide=id.g71b0a47020_30_486), and so on. Although these are real worries to have, most are short-term pains. Assuming nothing changes in the expectations of Americans for the future over these next two months, things should return to normal and perhaps even a bit better.

But that's a big assumption. I'm comfortable making it, but are you?
