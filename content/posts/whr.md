For those of you who read through my [Weyerhaeuser post](https://www.aadhi.rocks/posts/weyerhaeuser-mar-2020/), the format of this one will be different. Notably - shorter. After posting a distilled version of my Weyerhaeuser post on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/fnl2zl/my_view_on_weyerhaeuser_wy/), I found that much of the info I included on the industry & company was not relevant.

With that aside, let's get started. Today I'd like to talk about [Whirlpool (WHR)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WHR/). The company, like [Weyerhaeuser (WY)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WY), is currently beat down - I assume from the COVID-19 shock. As I've mentioned before, I believe this [shock is temporary](https://www.aadhi.rocks/posts/covid-19/). Therefore I believe that now could be a great time to pick up WHR.

# Industry Analysis

Competition is fierce in the home appliance industry. Names like Electrolux, LG, Samsung, Haier, and Bosch are all key players. Cost is king in terms of determining profitability. As you can imagine - economies of scale are vital to achieving that cost advantage.

Supplier power is likely low. The materials used to make home appliances are mostly commodities. Think: [steel, copper, aluminum, and plastics](https://qamplify.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/washing-machine-front-back.pdf). Obviously LG, Samsung, etc. aren't making these appliances from scratch. But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine most component parts could be switched between suppliers if needed.

Customer power is medium. With the proliferation of the internet, product information is widely and easily accessible. In a purely logical world, this should lead to customers making decisions based on data. But we don't live in a purely logical world. Brand power is a real thing. Especially when it comes to something as important as keeping your clothes clean. If it ain't broke - why fix it?

Threat of new entrants is low when it comes to major appliances. Cooking appliances is more of a mixed bag.

With those tidbits aside, I view home appliances as a mature industry that has a few major players owning the majority of the market. Economies of scale are key to maintain price competitiveness and in return make it hard for new entrants to compete effectively. Said another way: great industry if you're one of the big players, not so much if you're starting a home appliance company today.

# Company Analysis

Whirlpool is **the** home appliance company. It owns brand names that most folks would be familiar with - besides their namesake - like Maytag & KitchenAid. 

They compete across three main market segments (% of revenue): laundry (30%), refrigerators & freezers (31%), and cooking appliances (23%). They are definitely the market leader when it comes to home appliances with [45% market share in laundry](https://www.statista.com/statistics/712023/united-states-statista-survey-washing-machine-brands-us-consumers-have-at-home/) and [22% market share in refrigerators & freezers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/711820/united-states-statista-survey-refrigerator-brands-us-consumers-have-at-home/).

Combined with strong and steady approximate FCFs (OCF - ICF) of $600M annually over the past five-years - it's no wonder I got interested when it's currently trading at a market cap of ~$5B. Now it's not all rosy. They've experienced two consecutive years ('17 - '18 and '18 - '19) of revenue declines. The declines are a result of international markets (Europe, LATAM, & Asia) and it's unclear if they'll persist going forward.

Moreover, Whirlpool has a significant debt load at $4.1B as of 2019 end compared to their current market cap which is hovering around $5B. Obviously debt of any notable level is a concern during the lockdown, but because of their [investment grade credit rating of Baa1](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Whirlpool-Corporation-credit-rating-825000) - I'm not as worried about their ability to refinance. I'll discuss that more further down below.

# My Decision & Rationale

I mentioned that Whirlpool is trading at roughly 8.3x P / FCF. Said another way, someone buying this firm today could expect to pay off their investment in 8.3 years. This ratio gets pretty close to approximating 'value' as it's often talked about in finance - but it doesn't capture one of the key principles of finance: risk.

So what are the risks with associated with Whirlpool? I see three main ones:

- Whirlpool is on the decline
- Whirlpool can't shift to e-commerce
- Whirlpool defaults on debt

Let's take these on one at a time.

## Company Decline

The worry here is that the company has passed it's productive years and is now on a downward spiral to oblivion. However, I don't believe this is the case. If the company were truly in decline, I'd expect to see declines across all geographical segments. Instead what we see is a decline in the international segments with a continued growth in the core US market:

**SOURCE**: Company 10K's

There's still a chance that the company is in the decline stage. But I find it unlikely. After all - have people stopped doing laundry?

## Shift to E-Commerce

In the past, homebuyers often went into a local hardware store (Lowe's, Home Depot, etc.). This used to provide a clear advantage: being able to measure these massive appliances before lugging them home. Nooks for laundry, refrigerators, and so on are often small. It's important to know the dimensions of the product before buying.

Nowadays all that information is online. You technically don't need to go in person to a store to buy these products. Just measure your nook at home and then find the info you need online, click buy, and wait for it to be delivered to you. Although this isn't the common practice yet - it's forecasted that [online sales of home appliances will only be growing in share](https://www.statista.com/outlook/16000000/102/household-appliances/europe#market-arpu) going forward.

Whether or not Whirlpool can successfully bridge the gap from the GTM model of yesterday to the GTM of the future is a big question in my mind. I think if nothing else, the brand name recognition of their products will help them to some extent in making this transition - but I have no edge when it comes to understanding their ability to shift company culture.

If I were to benchmark on how other legacy consumer companies have made this transition, it's probably not a great outlook.

## Debt Default

I wanted to talk about this one last, since it's a bit dependent on the other two risks. The most immediate dependency is the rate of Whirlpool's growth (or lack thereof) over the next few years. As I talked about above, I don't think it's likely that we'll see a rapid downward spiral from the company.

The second complicating factor is a failure to shift to e-commerce. Depending on how quickly consumers move online for home appliance purchases - this could be a big or small risk in the context of debt default. I believe this will end up being a smaller risk, since Whirlpool's brand is strong.

Finally, there's just straight out debt default as a result of the COVID shock. I think this is unlikely because of the Fed's assurance to help investment grade companies [refinance their debt if needed](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/03/25/stimulus-bill-gives-fed-direct-loan-funds-with-few-strings/). Whirlpool's [Baa1 rating](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Whirlpool-Corporation-credit-rating-825000) covers them here. If the worst comes to pass - Whirlpool also has roughly $2B in cash on their balance sheet that should be able to cushion them for a year or two.

# Concluding Words

There are a few risks to keep in mind about Whirlpool, but ultimately I believe the market has overreacted here. The strong brand name and cash flow generation will keep the company insulated from the short-run COVID shock and the long-run risks seem tacklable.

I had initially bought in near the low over the past week at $65, but even after shooting up to the current price point of $83 - I find Whirlpool rather attractive as long-term buy with a base case target price of $108.
