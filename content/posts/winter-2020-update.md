It's been a while since I've written. My [last post](https://www.aadhi.rocks/posts/ending-miniprinter) was in August 2020. As I think back on what I've done since then - it simultaneously feels like much and yet not much. As I reflect on the time spent, it's been split across 3 buckets:

- MBA Life
- Search Funds
- Programming

# MBA Life

I'm in the 2nd year of my MBA! Although it hasn't been what I expected going in - the upper valley of New Hampshire has been relatively untouched by COVID. For that (in the spirit of Thanksgiving) - I'm thankful. I still think about my post on the effect of [COVID on the US economy](https://www.aadhi.rocks/posts/covid-19) and laugh about how optimistic I was in some regards. I wouldn't have guessed that we'd be hitting new highs in COVID cases nearly a year later.

But, the change brought some innovative solutions from professors at Tuck. They've been great about keeping classes engaged despite the challenges that Zoom brings to the 'classic' MBA learning environment. The work has been more than I expected for my 2nd year; however, it's work I don't mind doing. In your 2nd year you have a fully elective-driven schedule. You choose your destiny and that makes managing and doing work significantly easier.

In tandem, most of my classmates and friends also came back to the upper valley in Fall. This led to small group gatherings that helped solidify the close connections I built during my 1st year. One deviation I'm noticing is that as my class disperses for Thanksgiving - I'm seeing more folks choosing not to return for Winter term. I believe this is partly driven by an unspoken acceptance that Winter term will also be virtual. Although I'm hoping for the best on this front, the data doesn't seem encouraging on a change.

# Search Funds

With the extra time I'm afforded due to a relatively light social calendar, I started to dive into a career path I'd considered pre-MBA but shelved: search funds. The gist of a search fund is an MBA candidate who raises $400K - $500K to search and acquire a small business in 2 years, then operate it for 5+ years. These businesses typically have:

- $1M - $5M in EBITDA
- 15%+ EBITDA margins
- Recurring revenues
- Low CAPEX requirements

This typically translates to services and software businesses - though deals have been done with manufacturing companies as well. It's a sped up path to being a CEO, that brings with it commensurate upside and downside. The path isn't for everyone and I've spent much of my free time exploring whether it's right for me. I'll be writing more about this going forward, but the TL;DR is that I'm looking to raise a search fund to run post-MBA.

# Programming

Most of my time is taken up by buckets 1 & 2, but I do tend to have a little extra run-off now and then. I usually fill this space with programming. I find that programming provides a welcome distraction from thinking about business. It's been a great outlet to let out some of my creative energy in a low-stakes situation.

# What's Next?

So that's what I've been up to since August. As I reflect on the path forward, I'd like to write more. This seems like a constant goal that's just out of reach. But each time I fail at it and try again - I do a little better.
