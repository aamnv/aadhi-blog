I mentioned in my last [update post](https://www.aadhi.rocks/posts/winter-2020-update) that I'm looking into search funds as a post-MBA goal, but I didn't really tell you much about what these things are. Fret not, because that's what this post is for.

# Search Fund Basics

A search fund is a pool of money used by a candidate to fund the search for a small business to acquire and run it on an ongoing basis. Usually these funds are raised by graduating MBAs who want to a jump start into the CEO seat. 

**Characteristics**

The types of businesses acquired also tend to have similar characteristics:

- $1M - $5M EBITDA 
- 15%+ EBITDA margins
- Recurring revenues
- Low CAPEX requirements
- Non-cyclical / low-cyclicality

Some underlying implicit assumptions also supporting this model are:

- MBA skillset is suited to scale companies up
- Generation of founders in US reaching retirement age (baby boomers)

**Stages of Search**

There are 4 stages to a search fund:

- Search capital raise (2 - 5 months)
- Acquisition search (1 - 2 years)
- Closing the transaction (2 - 6 months)
- Operating the company (5+ years)

It's important to note that there are two capital raises the searcher has to navigate. First they need to convince investors in search funds (institutionals, high-networth individuals, friends and family) to invest in funding their search. This capital raise is usually between $350K - $500K. Second the searcher needs to raise equity capital for the acquisition they'd like to do. This raise is significantly higher and the relationships developed with people during the search capital raise come into play to make this process...less painful.

Finally, after all this heartburn - the searcher has to then go and operate the company for ~5 years. Ultimately they'll need to exit the company (i.e. IPO or sell it) and return capital to their investors and take some for themselves. **If it went well**.

**Incentives**

That brings me to the incentives at play. For folks that invest in the search capital raise - they get compensated with:

- Participating preferred shares
- Preferred return (7% - 8%)
- 1.5x step up of capital
- Right of first refusal

Given that most investors usually take 1 unit (~$35K - $50K), investing in the search round is an option because of the right of first refusal. Once an acquisition is identified, the search capital investors have the option to invest in the acquisition pro-rata (i.e. equal equity contribution to their % share in the search round). They can choose to go forward or not. I've heard anecdotally there is almost always folks who drop out.

This leaves the searcher with an 'equity gap' that they need to fill to close the deal. They can then take the deal to other search investors who didn't join the search capital round or private equity investors, family offices, and so on. These investors get:

- Participating preferred shares
- Preferred return (7% - 8%)

Finally there's the searcher or operator themselves. Although they don't usually contribute equity to the deal, they do get rewarded in sweat equity. The searcher gets:

- Common shares up to 25%
- 1/3 vests on close
- 1/3 vests over X years (X is defined at deal time, but usually 4 - 5)
- 1/3 vests linearly after meeting a hurdle rate

The hurdle rate is usually 35% IRR or a multiple on invested capital after a certain number of years have elapsed.
