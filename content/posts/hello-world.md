Hi there internet denizen. My name is Aadhi. I'm currently an MBA student at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. In my free time I enjoy tackling side projects. These projects range from investing in the market, playing with raspberry pi's, or some casual programming.

I guess I'm just extremely curious and enjoy learning new things. The project that's taking the majority of my mental bandwidth right now is my side business: [MiniPrinter](https://www.etsy.com/shop/miniprinter). I 3D print miniatures for Dungeons and Dragons players. I started in January 2020 and it's been growing slowly but steadily.

Besides that, I also enjoy writing - even if I don't do it often. I believe that writing is a great way to crystallize learnings. It often reveals gaps in my logic that can be valuable...and frustrating. However, its value does outweigh the frustration I feel. That's why I'm starting this blog.

I'm not sure how often I'll write or exactly what I'll write about. I imagine there'll be phases where I'll go deep on something that's taken over my mind then switch to something completely different. 

The important thing to me is that I keep writing.
