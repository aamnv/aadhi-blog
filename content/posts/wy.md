Weyerhaeuser is a vertically integrated timberlands REIT whose main business is acquiring and maintaining timberlands (forests). They harvest these timberlands regularly and use the raw lumber to make wood products which they then sell to downstream businesses (ex. paper or construction companies). Before we chat indepth about their prospects, let's take a look at the industry as a whole.

# Industry Analysis

For my industry analysis, I like to use Porter's Six Forces model. It's not a perfect model, but it provides a useful (& repeatable) framework to analyze industries.

## Competition

Competition in the wood products industry is **high**. Lumber is a commodity and there is no shortage of timberlands across the world. The nature of the competition does vary though. There are different types of players that take stakes in timberlands. To outline them at a high level:

- **REITs**: Other companies like Weyerhaeuser (ex. Rayonier)
- **TIMOs**: Institutional investors that hire consultancies to buy and maintain timberlands (ex. CalPERS)
- **Individuals**: Usually rich individuals / families (ex. Sierra Pacific Industries / Emmerson Family)

## Power of Suppliers

If we assume that 'suppliers' for the wood products industry would be machinery providers, then we can conclude the power of suppliers is **high** as well. Timberland-specific machinery is dominated by a few players. Some recognizable names would be companies like [John Deere](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DE) and [Caterpillar](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CAT/).

There are also other point-players, but they are concentrated for any specific piece of machinery. Think, John Deere + 1 or Caterpillar + 1 for any particular category.

## Power of Customers

Power of customers is **medium or high**. Based on the limited customer data on CapIQ for WY, I noted that their main customers are distributors for construction companies (Builders FirstSource) or paper product companies (North Pacific Paper Corporation). Although not highly concentrated, wood and wood products are commodities - so customer power will be relatively high.

## Threat of New Entrants

Threat of new entrants is **low**. Starting a timberland company is no joke. The transaction costs are high (land audits, local laws & regulations, etc.) and economies of scale are key to maintaining a price competitive operation. I believe the barriers to entry are high enough to keep new entrants out.

## Viability of Substitutes

Probably **medium**. Wood products are used in a variety of applications. Paper has substitutes, but none that could be considered a perfect substitute. Similarly, wood used in construction might have substitutes (brick & steel namely), but neither would be a perfect substitute.

## Power of Complements

I'm actually not sure what would qualify as a 'complement' to the timberland cultivation business. Perhaps something that drives the residential housing market? Dunno. Will leave this alone for now.

Overall it seems that the timberland business would appear to be a highly unattractive industry. In these situations it's usually just a few companies that end up owning the majority of the market. In an industry that's dependent on economies of scale - usually it's large incumbents.

# Company Analysis

## General

So where does Weyerhaeuser fall on that scale? [#1 in terms of USA timberland acreage](https://www.statista.com/statistics/623363/leading-timberland-owners-in-the-united-states-by-land-ownership/) - beating out second place by nearly 6x. Far second goes to [Rayonier (RYN)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ryn).

What makes Weyerhaeuser even more interesting is that they're a vertically integrated wood products company. Not only do they acquire and cultivate timberlands - they also manufacture wood products. In fact, there are three main reportable segments:

- **Timberlands**: forest management and cultivation
- **Real Estate & ENR**: acquiring or selling real estate
- **Wood Products**: manufacture products for the residential, multi-family, and commercial markets

One note on Wood Products - by Weyerhaeuser's own admission, the majority of these products are sold to the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. This makes their success dependent on the health of the US economy and specifically the US residential housing market.

## Financial

Financially the company is a cash flow machine. Cash Flows from Operations have averaged above $1B+ (currently ~11x Price / CFO) over the past five years (2015 - 2019), which is great since the company is a REIT. The main characteristic of REITs to keep in mind is that the company needs to pay out [90%+ of taxable income out as a dividends to shareholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment_trust#United_States).

Now, things aren't all rosy. Revenues saw a -12% Y/Y dip in 2019 and there's $6.1B in long-term debt on the company's balance sheet. Their interest rate on the debt is roughly 6%. Cash holdings are also perhaps a bit low at $139M as of 2019 end. These facts taken in tandem with current economic uncertainty are definitely cause for worry.

And I think the market agrees. Weyerhaeuser is down 52% from Feb 21st - Mar 20st.

# My Decision & Rationale

As you're probably aware from my disclaimer at the header of this article - I bought. But why? My rationale breaks down to 3 main components:

- Nature of COVID-19
- Macro factors
- Weyerhaeuser's resiliency

The first two speak to the ongoing strength of the US economy, which is key for Weyerhaeuser's success while the third speaks to the strength of Weyerhaeuser's position in the timberland market.

## Nature of COVID-19

COVID-19 is an unforseen catastrophe. There's no doubt that the markets needed to correct to incorporate the economic costs associated with its rapid spread. However, I believe there's been an overreaction at this point. My hypothesis is that the widespread quarantines that we're currently subject to will be lifted in 2 - 3 months.

Assuming that holds, then it's important to note that COVID-19 hasn't done anything to materially reduce the productive capacity of the US economy over the long-run. I talk about this specific aspect more in my [COVID-19 post](https://www.aadhi.rocks/posts/covid-19/).

Therefore, if we were riding a sustainable bull market pre-COVID - I believe we'll revert to the same post-COVID.

## Macro Factors

There are a few US macro data points that bode well for the residential housing market:

- Housing starts are [trending upwards](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qnhr)
- Home ownership rates are [trending upwards](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qnhI)
- Rental vacancy rates are [trending downwards](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qnhN)
- [30-year](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US) and [15-year](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE15US) mortgage rates are at historical lows

Combined with the recent rate cuts by the Fed, I believe they're pouring fuel on a fire that never truly went out. Although I have to admit that much of the FRED data above is lagging and we'll need to see what COVID does to all of them - my thesis is that the US economy is fundamentally strong and only in hibernation as a result of forced quarantines.

## Weyerhaeuser's Resiliency

Finally, let's talk about Weyerhaeuser. As the leading timberland REIT by nearly 6x in terms of acreage and 4x market cap - I believe they have a natural advantage in a commoditized industry. In near perfect competition industry, the most productive producer should be affected least by shifts down in demand. With their advantage via economies of scale, I believe that although demand for lumber will fall in general - Weyerhaeuser will be best positioned in the industry to survive the downturn.

# The Risks

## Long-Term Recession

My biggest worry when it comes to investing in this stock (& really the market) is that Americans have started to believe we're in a long-term recession - even though the productive capacity of the US hasn't changed. Yes, we have spiked downwards in terms of actual production as a result of the lockdowns but capital stock and labor are still mostly in tact.

If people and businesses believe that we aren't in a long-term recession, they'll continue to consume & invest given that interest rates are going to all-time lows. That consumption in turn will keep us out of a recession. But if they think we're going into a recession, they'll start curbing consumption and investment in lieu of saving and cause a recession. 

It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. One that I believe won't come to pass for recession, but time will tell.

## Balance Sheet

The other obvious risk is the company's balance sheet. They have a high debt load with relatively low cash balances. If we do enter a long-term recession, then the company is at a real risk of going bunk. Their first big principal repayment is coming up in 2021 and although they may be able to refinance - times are too uncertain to tell.

# Concluding Thoughts

My feeling is that COVID-19 will pass in a few months. The situation thus far and going forward will no doubt have a major effect on the financials of Weyerhaeuser in 2020. However, the intrinsic value of a company is often dependent on the cash flows going forward in perpetuity - captured in the terminal value. Even if the cash flows for 2020 are low / negative - if we avoid a long-term recession, then the stock should start paying significant dividends in 2021 and onwards.

I'm comfortable taking that bet. But that doesn't mean you should be or that you will. As always - do your own research.
