Michael Burry (of The Big Short fame) recently started posting on Twitter. He started off strong by sharing his view on the COVID-19 lockdowns:

> If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justification for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.

The [gist of Burry's point](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/big-short-s-michael-burry-joins-twitter-with-pleas-to-end-covid-19-lockdown-1.1417820) seems to be that shutting down an entire economy will cause more damage than just asking the at-risk populations to self-quarantine. Yet we seem to have shifted to the extreme as a nation without considering the spectrum of options inbetween.

It's not an emotionally appealing argument, but it's a fair one. However - instead of arguing the pros & cons of the argument, the internet saw fit to [jump on Burry's financial stake](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw0qmg/michael_j_burry_joins_twitter_with_pleas_to_end/) in [making that statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/fvx6vn/big_shorts_michael_burry_joins_twitter_with_pleas/).

I get why. It's an emotionally charged issues and he's making a controversial statement. He didn't disclose his positions in his tweet and so people feel he was trying to 'dupe' them. Now that probably wasn't Burry's actual intention. Could you imagine how onerous it'd be to constantly restate your market positions everytime you make a statement?

But I also empathize with the other side - no one wants to be taken for a sucker. That's why I'm going to try a little personal experiment: [sharing my portfolio positions openly](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ZHkITe8a-mefSKsrDYNhp_ImOhQMGGDbTt44yad-tI/edit?usp=sharing). 

The only thing I plan on keeping private is the absolute size of my positions. Weights are provided though. Let's see how this goes.
