- Hardware is hard (for bootstrapped solo-founders)
	- Scalability is everything
	- Removing supports vs. adding code
	- Profits (& margins) are what matter
- Respect for people who take the shot
	- Tried X ideas before this one and failed
	- Creating something from nothing is hard
- Burnout is the real enemy
	- Enjoy the journey, not the destination
		- Don't overfocus on monetary goals
		- Focus on the learning and experiences
	- Little bit every day
		- Keep moving the ball forward
		- Overestimate what we do in a week, underestimate what we do in a month
- You don't need a unique idea
	- Differentiate
	- An existing idea is easier!
