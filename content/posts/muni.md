I was reading [Markets (WSJ newsletter)](https://www.wsj.com/newsletters) this week and saw [mention about the municipal bond market](https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-funding-woes-are-dragging-the-fed-into-muni-market-reboot-11586338203?mod=djemMoneyBeat_us). Although I knew that this market referred to bonds issued by local government authorities and had some tax-favorable treatment - I didn't know much else. That's why I was blown away  when I realized [22% of all securities held by mutual funds in the US are municipal bonds](https://www.statista.com/statistics/255547/percentage-of-total-market-securities-held-by-investment-companies/). So I spent some time this weekend doing a bit of research.

# Defining a Municipal Bond

Municipal bonds (Munis) are debt instruments issued by local government (states, counties, cities, etc.) that raise funds for local projects. The nature of these local projects vary. Perhaps the funds are being used to build bridges and schools...or a [botanical garden](https://www.cityofmadison.com/community-bonds). In terms of security characteristics they are similar to other bonds in most respects (debt instruments, semi-annual payments if coupon, and so on).

In contrast to other bonds - munis are often noted for their tax-exempt status. But this status doesn't always hold. In fact, there are a [whole host of edge cases where you'll end up being taxed](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/not-always-tax-free-7-municipal-bond-tax-traps). Most of these reasons end up being personal - but at the muni level, the main determinant of tax-exempt status is whether the funds will be used for private or public purpose.

Quick example: if the bonds are being sold to fund pension obligations - they will **not** be tax-exempt.

# Types of Munis

There are two major types of municipal bonds:

- General obligation
- Revenue

General obligation (GO) bonds are paid back using tax revenues. Revenue bonds are paid back using revenues from the associated project that the funds will create. An important difference between the two is the level of security. GO bonds are backed by the full faith of the government issuing them. Revenue bonds are only secured by the revenues generated by the project it's funding.

One more interesting note - sometimes non-profits and private organizations can issue munis via local government to fund projects in the public interest. In this case the local government is only acting as a conduit rather than the debtor.

# Buying Munis

Buying munis seems to work the same way as any other security. You can buy specific munis via a broker (ex. Fidelity),  financial advisor, secondary market, and so on. You can also indirectly hold baskets of munis by investing in specific mutual funds / ETFs that provide that service. Some Googling should yield the results you're looking for if you want to go down that path.

# Concluding Words

So why'd I write this up? Just curiosity. I read the article I mentioned above on muni bonds and remembered I saw a startup trying to reinvent the muni bond market by making it accessible to mom & pop a few years ago. Naturally I got to Googling and found out that [the company (Neighborly) shutdown in 2019](https://www.govtech.com/biz/Gov-Tech-Startup-Neighborly-Runs-Out-of-Money-to-Pay-Workers.html) after erratic spending and strategy by their leadership.

But was there more to the failure than just questionable choices? Probably. The premise that people would want to invest in munis that fund local projects could be inherently flawed. If I think about my behavior when investing I care about one thing: risk-adjusted return. If muni bonds are a vehicle to increase my risk-adjusted return, then sure - I'll invest.

That's where I think the startup ran into a wall. I don't have time to monitor munis being issued locally to see if:

- The funds are going to something I care about
- My municipality is credit worthy
- Are offering a return that is appealing
- Don't have any hidden features (call options)
- Would positively affect the risk-profile of my portfolio

And so on. But it is an interesting instrument to keep in mind. There are definitely economic periods where I could see myself investing in tax-exempt muni bonds instead of corporate securities.
